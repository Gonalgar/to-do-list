# To-Do List Project

This is a **To-Do List** application built as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) JavaScript curriculum. The project focuses on using **JavaScript modules**, **Webpack**, and **localStorage** to create a fully functional task management app.

## Features

- **Add, Edit, and Delete Tasks**: Users can manage their to-do items dynamically.
- **Project Organization**: Tasks can be categorized under different projects.
- **Task Details**: Each task can have a title, description, due date, and priority level.
- **Local Storage Persistence**: Tasks and projects are saved even after refreshing the page.
- **Modular Code Structure**: Uses JavaScript ES6 modules for maintainability.
- **Responsive Design**: Works on both desktop and mobile screens.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Markup for structuring the app.
- **CSS3**: Styling for a clean and intuitive UI.
- **JavaScript (ES6)**: Handles task creation, editing, and deletion.
- **Webpack**: Bundles JavaScript modules for better performance.
- **localStorage**: Saves user data for persistence.
